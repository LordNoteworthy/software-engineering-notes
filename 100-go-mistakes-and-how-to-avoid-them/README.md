# 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

notes taken from reading the *100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them* by Teiva Harsanyi.

## Chapter 1: Go: Simple to learn but hard to master.

- Google created the Go programming language in 2007 in response to these challenges:
  - maximizing agility and reducing the time to market is critical for most organizations
  - ensure that software engineers are as productive as possible when reading, writing, and maintaining code
- Why does Go not have feature *X*?
  - because it doesnâ€™t fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.
- Judging the quality of a programming language via its number of features is probably not an accurate metric ðŸ’¯.
- Go's essential characteristics: Stability, Expressivity, Compilation, Safety.
- Go is simple but not easy:
  - Example:  Study shows that popular repos such as Docker, gRPC, and Kubernetes contain bugs are caused by inaccurate use of the message-passing paradigm via channels.
  - Although a concept such as channels and goroutines can be simple to learn, it isnâ€™t an easy topic in practice.
-  The cost of software bugs in the U.S. alone to be over $2 trillion ðŸ˜¢.

## Chapter 2: Code and project organization

## #1: Unintended variable shadowing

- In Go, a variable name declared in a block can be redeclared in an inner block.
- Variable shadowing occurs when a variable name is redeclared in an inner block, but we saw that this practice is prone to mistakes:
```go
var client *http.Client
if tracing {
    client, err := createClientWithTracing()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    log.Println(client)
} else {
    client, err := createDefaultClient()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    log.Println(client)
}
// Use client
```

## #2: Unnecessary nested code

- A critical aspect of readability is the number of nested levels.
- In general, the more nested levels a function requires, the more complex it is to read and understand:
    ```go
    func join(s1, s2 string, max int) (string, error) {
        if s1 == "" {
            return "", errors.New("s1 is empty")
        } else {
            if s2 == "" {
                return "", errors.New("s2 is empty")
            } else {
                concat, err := concatenate(s1, s2)
                if err != nil {
                    return "", err
                } else {
                    if len(concat) > max {
                        return concat[:max], nil
                    } else {
                        return concat, nil
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- *Align the happy path to the left; you should quickly be able to scan down one column to see the expected execution flow*.
- When an if block returns, we should omit the else block in all cases.
- If we encounter a non happy-path, we should flip the condition like so:
    ```go
    if s == "" {
        return errors.New("empty string")
    }
    // ...
    ```
