# 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

notes taken from reading the *100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them* by Teiva Harsanyi.

## Chapter 1: Go: Simple to learn but hard to master.

- Google created the Go programming language in 2007 in response to these challenges:
  - maximizing agility and reducing the time to market is critical for most organizations
  - ensure that software engineers are as productive as possible when reading, writing, and maintaining code
- Why does Go not have feature *X*?
  - because it doesnâ€™t fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.
- Judging the quality of a programming language via its number of features is probably not an accurate metric ðŸ’¯.
- Go's essential characteristics: Stability, Expressivity, Compilation, Safety.
- Go is simple but not easy:
  - Example:  Study shows that popular repos such as Docker, gRPC, and Kubernetes contain bugs are caused by inaccurate use of the message-passing paradigm via channels.
  - Although a concept such as channels and goroutines can be simple to learn, it isnâ€™t an easy topic in practice.
-  The cost of software bugs in the U.S. alone to be over $2 trillion ðŸ˜¢.
